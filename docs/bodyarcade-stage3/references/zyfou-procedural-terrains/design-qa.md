# Design QA — Tool-oriented Project Workspace

Source visual truth: `C:\Users\zyfod\.codex\generated_images\019f48ab-efb9-72a0-a267-fae27eab7688\exec-51532559-1b7d-4965-bb45-3ccc25d137ea.png` (selected third workspace direction).

Implementation evidence: browser-rendered capture of `http://127.0.0.1:6061` in the Codex in-app browser, desktop viewport. Verified in both Projects and Templates states with one local Island project.

## Findings

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences.
- [P3] The mock includes image thumbnails for every template; the implementation intentionally uses the editor’s icon system for template choices and reserves thumbnails for actual saved projects. This avoids misleading stock terrain previews and keeps the project manager tool-oriented.
- [P3] The mock’s inspector has an image preview; the implementation uses a reserved inspector icon surface until a saved project supplies its real canvas thumbnail.

## Fidelity surfaces

- **Fonts and typography:** Uses the editor’s existing UI and mono-token hierarchy, with compact labels, 21px workspace titles, and 12px list rows.
- **Spacing and layout rhythm:** Fixed 54px topbar, 252px create/template sidebar, fluid central project workspace, and 292px inspector. No action introduces a popup or reflows a different region.
- **Colors and tokens:** Uses only the editor’s base tokens: #050505, #0d0d0d, #141414, #1a1a1a, #262626, and #2563eb; the prior grey cinematic overlay is removed.
- **Image quality and asset fidelity:** Actual saved project thumbnails are sourced from the WebGL canvas. Template choices are represented as editor tool controls rather than decorative terrain imagery.
- **Copy and content:** Project, template, inspector, import, and creation labels match the selected tool-workspace framing.

## Interaction evidence

1. **Projects workspace — healthy:** Recent Island project is displayed in the central table; selecting it populates the inspector.
2. **Templates tab — healthy:** Opening Templates switches the centre content to the template grid and changes the inspector to Blank terrain, without any floating UI.
3. **Persistent controls — healthy:** New terrain, Open project, Import, templates, and inspector action stay inside fixed columns.
4. **Console — healthy:** No browser console errors.

## Implementation checklist

- [x] Replaced the marketing landing composition with a fixed editor workspace.
- [x] Removed terrain backdrop, hero copy, footer, dropdowns, and project popups from this surface.
- [x] Added Projects/Templates navigation, persistent template selection, central project list, and contextual inspector.
- [x] Preserved local project creation, import, persistence, and editor hand-off.

## Follow-up polish

- Add explicit rename, duplicate, and delete actions to the project table overflow menu.
- Add optional project-thumbnail refresh from the inspector.

## Top bar iteration — 2026-07-10

Source visual truth: user-approved top-bar concept from the current conversation.

Implementation evidence: browser-rendered capture of the local editor at desktop viewport.

- **Header hierarchy:** Search remains visible; File consolidates New, Projects, Save, and Load; Randomize and Paint remain adjacent; Tile / Infinite World / Planet stays centered; Export remains primary on the right.
- **Interaction:** File opens as an accessible menu, exposes New / Projects / Save / Load, closes on Escape, and closes when clicking outside.
- **Regression check:** Left rail, terrain canvas, world-mode switcher, Export, and bottom status bar remain present and functional.
- **Console:** No browser errors or warnings observed.

## Top bar annotation pass — 2026-07-10

- **Order:** File, Randomize, Paint, Search, centered world modes, Creator history, Export, then utilities.
- **Centering:** World modes use a fixed header midpoint, independent of the left and right control widths.
- **Responsive fit:** At medium desktop widths, low-priority Undo/Redo buttons and Randomize/Paint labels collapse so the centered mode switcher never overlaps the search field.
- **Browser verification:** Header geometry measured at 1280px: mode center 640px, with the left action group ending at 506px and the mode group starting at 526px.
- **File menu regression:** New, Projects, Save, and Load remain present and the menu opens successfully after the reorder.

final result: passed
