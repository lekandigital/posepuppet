/**
 * Updates the physics state (buoyancy, gravity, drag/friction, and pool floor collision)
 * for a simulation object.
 *
 * How the physics simulation works:
 * 1. Drag / Velocity Reset during interaction:
 *    If the object is being dragged by the cursor, its velocity is forced to 0 so it doesn't
 *    accrue kinetic energy while under manual control.
 *
 * 2. Buoyancy:
 *    We calculate the fraction of the object that is submerged in the water.
 *    The water surface is located at y = 0.
 *    For a sphere of radius R, the vertical boundaries are [y - R, y + R].
 *    - If the top of the object (y + R) is below y = 0, the object is completely submerged (percent = 1).
 *    - If the bottom of the object (y - R) is above y = 0, the object is completely out of water (percent = 0).
 *    - Otherwise, it is partially submerged, calculated as a linear interpolation:
 *      percent = clamp((R - position.y) / (2 * R), 0, 1)
 *
 *    The net acceleration vector is:
 *      acceleration = gravity * (1.0 - buoyancyScale * percentSubmerged)
 *    Where buoyancyScale is derived from the liquid density. If density is high, the buoyancy force is strong,
 *    causing lighter objects to float back to the surface.
 *
 * 3. Drag / Water Friction:
 *    Water resistance exerts a dampening force proportional to the square of the speed (drag force = -c * v^2).
 *    This force opposes the direction of movement and is scaled by the submergence percentage
 *    (objects experience no water drag when completely in the air).
 *
 * 4. Euler Integration:
 *    Position is updated using the standard forward Euler step: position += velocity * dt.
 *
 * 5. Pool Bottom Collision (Elastic Bounce):
 *    If the object's bottom boundary drops below the pool floor (floorY = clearance - poolHeight),
 *    we clamp its vertical position exactly to the pool floor and invert its vertical velocity,
 *    multiplied by a restitution coefficient (0.7) to simulate an elastic bounce.
